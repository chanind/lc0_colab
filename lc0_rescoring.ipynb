        "This Colab runs the rescorer to improve the training data used for model training in leela chess zero. Rescoring makes uses of [syzygy tablebases](https://syzygy-tables.info/), which are lists of perfect endgames for all games with less than 5 (or 6 or 7) pieces remaining on the board. If any training games end up in a position that's known in the tablebase, the rescorer will rewrite the game using the known perfect play from the tablebase so that leela can lean from a perfect endgame rather than the potential mistakes in the traning game.\n",

        "Rescoring is used in the training of all the best nets for leela, and should always be used before running training for best results. Rescoring is CPU-only."
