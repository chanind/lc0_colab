## Leela Chess Zero Elo Testing

This Colab implements the ideas from the [Lc0 Testing Guide](https://lczero.org/dev/wiki/testing-guide/) to test out Lc0 by having it compete against other chess engines. Edit this Colab to test out different configurations or networks for Lc0, or use it as as base for your own explorations. The implementation presented here just runs standard Lc0 against standard Stockfish.
